### Introduction

### Agile Project Management
One of the main skills needed for a software engineering project and beyond is being able to use agile project management and the ability to work effectively with a team. 

### Coding Standards
Software engineering is like writing an essay or learning a new language. There are grammatical, vocabulary, and sturctural rules everyone must follow in order to ensure clarity, consistency, and quality. It is like an art on communication. Software engineering is the same way. In any code that someone may write, there must contain cosistency and readability in order for all software engineers to be able to read the code. This is especially important when working on a team which all software engineers must do. At first, I had some level of annoyance trying to learn coding standards, getting errors for wrong indentation or not following ESLint rules. But as I progressed, I found my codes to be more organized, readable, dare I say, prettier when following universal coding standards. I am just starting out in my software engineering journey, but I fully believe that coding standards are a skill that I will need as I progress in my academic journey and beyond. 

### Ethics in Software Engineering
