### Introduction

### Agile Project Management
One of the main skills needed for a software engineering project and beyond is being able to use agile project management and the ability to work effectively with a team. 

### Coding Standards
Software engineering is like writing an essay or learning a new language. There are grammatical, vocabulary, and sturctural rules everyone must follow in order to ensure clarity, consistency, and quality. It is like an art on communication. Software engineering is the same way. In any code that someone may write, there must contain cosistency and readability in order for all software engineers to be able to read the code. This is especially important when working on a team which all software engineers must do. At first, I had some level of annoyance trying to learn coding standards, getting errors for wrong indentation or not following ESLint rules. But as I progressed, I found my codes to be more organized, readable, dare I say, prettier when following universal coding standards. I am just starting out in my software engineering journey, but I fully believe that coding standards are a skill that I will need as I progress in my academic journey and beyond. 

### Ethics in Software Engineering
Technology is and continues to grow into one of the most important and impactful aspects of everyoneʻs lives. For myself, growing up with the internet, I canʻt picture a life without technology. Now more than ever, itʻs important to remember that though technology as a whole has had a generally postive impact in our lives, there are still aspects that can hurt people. There are many ethical issues in software engineering that should be considered, like privacy, security, and even societal impact. In software engineering, as well as all aspects of life, itʻs important to go forth with the skills and knowledge needed to make ethical and informed decisions in both our academic and professional careers as anything we do can have a positive or negative impact on others. 

### Conclusion
As I end the beginning of my journey in software engineering, I will continue on in my studies with valuable skills and knowledge that I will need in future classes and even more professional roles. Agile project management, teamwork, and ethics are all skills that I plan on utilizing in the future. A combination of these skills and many more will ensure my success in my career.
